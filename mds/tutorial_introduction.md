About
---------
I will walk you through the creation of a basic blog. A assume you already have Ringo installed. See [Getting Started] if you need help with that.

The final, refined app developed in this tutorial is on github [http://github.com/oberhamsi/ringo-tutorial-demoblog](http://github.com/oberhamsi/ringo-tutorial-demoblog).

Help
------
If you run into trouble do not hesitate to ask for help on [Ringo's Mailinglist](http://groups.google.com/group/ringojs) or you can join us on IRC [#ringojs on irc.freenode.net](http://ringojs.com/bot/join).
