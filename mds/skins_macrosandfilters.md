Macros & Filters
------------------

We already have quite a lot of [useful filters](http://ringojs.org/api/master/ringo/skin/filters) and [macros](http://ringojs.org/api/master/ringo/skin/macros) in Ringo.
    
The [Skins Demo](http://ringojs.org/demo/skins) also shows of some skin features I did not mention.

FIXME 
  * were to configure macros (config.js array). they just something that is part of the skin context.
  * how to write macros & filter. at least 1 simple example for both.
